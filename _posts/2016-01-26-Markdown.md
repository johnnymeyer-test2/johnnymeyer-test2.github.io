Markdown is a lightweight markup language designed so that it can be converted to HTML or other formats. It provides a structured way to write content for the web, and is written in __plaintext__ along with a few special symbols.

To put text in _italics_ surround the text with a single underscore or asterisk on each side: \_italics\_ or \*italics\*. This puts the text inside an `emph` tag.

To put text in **bold** surround it with two underscores or asterisks on each side: \*\*bold\*\* or \_\_bold\_\_. This places the text inside a `strong` tag.

To make a line a heading precede it with one to six hash symbols (for headings h1 up to h6): \# Heading 1.

To make a [link](https://www.google.com) enclose the desired inline text in square brackets followed by enclosing the url in round brackets: \[link\]\(http://www.google.com\).
