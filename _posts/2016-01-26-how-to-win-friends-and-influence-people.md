# Intro
* The two things adults are most interested in are health and people.
* Technical skills only account for about 15% of financial success. The other 85% is due to human engineering - to personality and the ability to lead people.
* The person who has technical skills _plus_ the ability to express ideas, to assume leadership, and to arouse enthusiasm among people - that person is headed for higher earning power.

# If You Want to Gather Honey, Don't Kick Over the Beehive
* When dealing with people we are not dealing with creatures of logic we are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.
* By criticising we do not make lasting changes and often incur resentment.
* Sharp criticisms and rebukes almost invariably end in futility.
* **Principle 1:** Don't criticise, condemn or complain.

# The Big Secret of Dealing With People
* One of the deepest urges in human nature is the desire to be important, to be great, to be appreciated.
* Appreciation is sincere. Flattery is insincere.
* **Principle 2:** Give honest and sincere appreciation.

# He Who Can Do This Has the Whole World With Him
* Everyone is interested in what _they_ want.
* The only way to influence other people is to talk about what _they_ want and show them how to get it.
* **Principle 3:** Arouse in the other person an eager want.

# Do This and You'll Be Welcome Anywhere
* You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in people than in two years by trying to make people interested in you.
* **Principle 4:** Become genuinely interested in other people.
