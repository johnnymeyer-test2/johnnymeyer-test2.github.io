# Intro
* The two things adults are most interested in are health and people.
* Technical skills only account for about 15% of financial success. The other 85% is due to human engineering - to personality and the ability to lead people.
* The person who has technical skills _plus_ the ability to express ideas, to assume leadership, and to arouse enthusiasm among people - that person is headed for higher earning power.

# If You Want to Gather Honey, Don't Kick Over the Beehive
* When dealing with people we are not dealing with creatures of logic we are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.
* By criticising we do not make lasting changes and often incur resentment.
* Sharp criticisms and rebukes almost invariably end in futility.
* **Principle 1:** Don't criticise, condemn or complain.

# The Big Secret of Dealing With People
* One of the deepest urges in human nature is the desire to be important, to be great, to be appreciated.
* 'I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people the greatest asset I possess, and the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement.' - Charles Schwab
* Appreciation is sincere. Flattery is insincere.
